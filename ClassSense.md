## Motivation

ClassSense is an application created by students for students. We've all been in a position where the professor is lecturing and then all of a sudden s/he says something that goes way over our heads. Most people are confused but no one wants to be the guy that has to stop the class. If only they had a way to measure a general consensus of how confused the class truly is. That's what ClassSense is all about. It utilizes crowd-sourcing to present real time data to the professor in the terms of an easy to digest distribution graph. All the students need to do is utilize the ClassSense app on their mobile device and indicate how confused they are. The professor will then get an aggregation of all this data that is processed into a graph to let him/her know where the class stands in terms of how deeply they understand what was just said.

## What We Used
* Firebase
* NativeScript
* HighChart

Utilizing Firebase we were able to collect real time data without worrying about latency. We understood the importance of being as accurate as possible when it comes to getting direct feedback from students. We also new that reaching all platforms was key so using NativeScript to be able to accommodate both Android and IOS.

## Challenges

During our 24 hour experience, naturally, we ran into many issues.

dunno what to say lol halp

TESSSTTT


*A Special Thanks to the guys from Firebase and NativeScript for tirelessly helping us out through the 24 hour hackathon!*
